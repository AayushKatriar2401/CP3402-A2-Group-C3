# Applications and Processes

Efficient communication and seamless project management are paramount for the success of any collaborative endeavour. In our workflow, we have employed Discord, Notion, and GitHub as integral tools to facilitate daily communication, track progress, and manage our project effectively. This documentation provides an overview of each platform's role in supporting our team's collaboration and productivity. 

Discord: Discord serves as our primary platform for daily communication and collaboration. Its versatile features enable us to share important links, provide updates, plan meetings, and exchange ideas, tutorials, and designs seamlessly. By utilizing Discord's text channels, voice channels, and direct messaging capabilities, we ensure effective and efficient communication within our team. 

Notion: To maintain organized project management, we rely on Notion as our go-to tool. Notion's flexible and customizable interface allows us to create a centralized workspace where we can track tasks, monitor progress, and collaborate on various project aspects. Through Notion, we allocate tasks, define deadlines, and track completed tasks, ensuring transparency and accountability among team members. 

GitHub: GitHub serves as our dedicated platform for version control and repository management. With GitHub, we create a repository where we store our project files, including the website's details, content, and associated assets. This enables us to effectively manage different versions of the project, collaborate on code development, and seamlessly integrate changes made by team members.

# Hosting and Deployment

For the hosting we used Amazon Web Services and developed an EC2 using bitnami to write webpages using WordPress.

# Project Management

We used Notion for Project Management and were following the Kanban Framework which utilizes visual tracking of all members and activities while developing the site, we had three sections to record tracking items, and sections which display what is to be done what is in the process of being done and what has been completed. Thanks to Notion and its myriad of features we were able to create an overall flow for the project based on the tasks we were to accomplish.

# Environment Overview

We used Amazon Web Services to set up our virtual environment, first we started a new instance, and for the software we used Ubuntu, and a virtual server was a t2.micro as it was free of cost.
